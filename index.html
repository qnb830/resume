      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Having been working as a System Engineer in Tata Consultancy Services, I
        always found myself confronted with both various and complex problem
        sets and challenging client demands. The rapid development of technology
        and business requirements encourage me to constantly adapt and to
        continue learning. Being an early adopter of new and quickly evolving
        tools.<br />
        I always enjoyed both learning these tools and passing on my knowledge
        to my colleagues. Since working as an automation tester implies a high
        affinity to programming, I also enjoy working as an automation engineer.
