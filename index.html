      <h3>About.</h3>
      <div class="detail">
        <p>
          Having been working as a System Engineer in Tata Consultancy Services,
          I always found myself confronted with both various and complex problem
          sets and challenging client demands. The rapid development of
          technology and business requirements encourage me to constantly adapt
          and to continue learning. Being an early adopter of new and quickly
          evolving tools.<br />
          I always enjoyed both learning these tools and passing on my knowledge
          to my colleagues. Since working as an automation tester implies a high
          affinity to programming, I also enjoy working as an automation
          engineer.
        </p>
        <p>Currently i am working as a automation and performance analyst.</p>
